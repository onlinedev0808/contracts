> Looking for version 1? Click [here](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/contracts/tree/v1)!

## Quick start

The [`@thirdweb-dev/contracts`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@thirdweb-dev/contracts) package gives you access to all contracts and interfaces available in the `/contracts` directory of this repository.

**Installation:**
```bash
yarn add @thirdweb-dev/contracts
```

**Usage:**

`@thirdweb-dev/contracts` can be used in your Solidity project just like other popular libraries like `@openzeppelin/contracts`. Once you've installed the package, import the relevant resources from the package as follows:

```solidity
// Example usage

import "@thirweb-dev/contracts/contracts/interfaces/token/TokenERC721.sol";

contract MyNFT is TokenERC721 { ... }
```

## Run locally

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/contracts.git
```

This repository is a hybrid [hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) and [forge](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/forge) project.

First install the relevant dependencies of the project:
```bash
yarn

forge install
```

To compile contracts, run:
```bash
forge build
```

Or, if you prefer hardhat, you can run:
```bash
npx hardhat compile
```


To run tests:
```bash
forge test
```

To export the ABIs of the contracts in the `/contracts` directory, run:
```
npx hardhat export-abi
```

To run any scripts in the `/scripts` directory, run:
```
npx hardhat run scripts/{path to the script}
```
